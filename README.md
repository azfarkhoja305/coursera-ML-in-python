# gen-purpose-ML
General Purpose Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications in Python developed using numpy, scipy and matplotlib 
libraries implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository contains:    
* Python implementation of certain assignments I completed as part of the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The assignments were originally implemented in Octave.
* Self implemented pet projects   
Handwritten Digit recognition using the entire MNIST Dataset is one such example for now
