Handwritten Digit classification using the entire MNIST Dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/  
The training and the test set consist of 60,000 and 10,000 samples respectively. Each sample is a 28x28 pixel image.  

The classification was implemented using a three layer neural network with 784 input units, 300 hidden units and 10 output units.
Due to the processing requirements, this had to be implemented in Google Colaboratory.  
Classification accuracy obtained on the test set: 94.58 %
